The SuluRedirectBundle adds simple but powerful capabilities for managing redirects to Sulu‚Äôs administration interface
and allows content managers to manage redirects without any knowledge of web servers.

The SuluRedirectBundle is compatible with Sulu **starting from version 2.0**. Have a look at the `require` section in
the [composer.json](https://github.com/sulu/SuluRedirectBundle/blob/2.x/composer.json) to find an
**up-to-date list of the requirements** of the bundle.

## üöÄ&nbsp; Installation and Documentation

Execute the following [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) commands to add the bundle to the dependencies of your
project:

```bash
composer require sulu/redirect-bundle
```

Afterwards, visit the [bundle documentation](https://github.com/sulu/SuluRedirectBundle/blob/2.x/Resources/doc/README.md) to
find out **how to set up and configure the SuluRedirectBundle** to your specific needs.

## üí°&nbsp; Features

### Importing redirects

One of the great features of this bundle is the ability to import redirects from a CSV file.
The most simplified file just contains two columns, `source` and `target`.
Of course, all the other options like `statusCode`, `sourceHost`, and `enabled` can also be set in the import file.

It‚Äôs also possible to override existing redirects with an import; you just have to set the same value for `source`.

### Enabling and disabling redirects

Sometimes it‚Äôs necessary to prepare redirects which are not ready yet, especially if you have a large number of redirects.
Of course there‚Äôs a solution for that ‚Äî toggler in the toolbar to enable or disable redirects quickly.
This allows you to import a large number of disabled redirects and then check them in the administration interface,
before enabling them when needed.

### Different statuses

The SuluRedirectBundle comes with three different statuses to be used for redirects:

- **301** Moved permanently
- **302** Moved temporarily
- **410** Gone

Those status codes are explained in detail [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

### Automatic `Gone` redirects

This bundle also adds the possibility to automatically create redirects with status `410 Gone`, if a page or a entity with a route has been removed. This is very useful, because now search engines know, that that page has been deleted.
